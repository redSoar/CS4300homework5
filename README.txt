Implemented Features:
- Everything from Assignment 3 works fully
- Our scene contains our drone model (can be viewed in drone.txt). It has two propellor fans, each with four blades. The drone has four legs.
- The propellors are perpetually rotating to show the drone flying. The speed of the propellors can be changed using the 's' and 'f' keys. The 'j'
  key will make the drone do a sideways roll (it will roll 360 degrees in place)
- We have implemented the movement and rotation controls mapped to '+', '-', and arrow keys, and the drone position and rotation will be reset by
  'd' or 'D'
- We have implemented the global and chopper cameras, as well as the key codes '1' and '2' to switch between them. We decided to have the trackball
  only be usable when the global camera is active.

Incomplete(ish) Features:
- The drone camera is mapped to the key code '3'. It is placed on top of the drone, so the user will still be able to see a bit of the drone
  on the bottom side of the window. The camera is facing out of behind the drone, so the controls are inverted when using the FPS Camera.

Work Split:
- Everything was done on call together; we collaborated on every aspect of the program that we added or created.
