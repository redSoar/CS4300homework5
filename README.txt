Implemented Features:
- Nothing

Incomplete Features:
- The drone camera is mapped to the key code '3'. It is placed on top of the drone, so the user will still be able to see a bit of the drone
  on the bottom side of the window. The camera is facing out of behind the drone, so the controls are inverted when using the FPS Camera.

Work Split:
- We tried to collaborate in implementing the lighting; we got as far as extending the ScenegraphImporter and SGNode to support the new commands in the scenegraph files
- After that, we split up the work:
  - Jae-Min focused on implmenting the rest of the lighting
  - Akash focused on implementing the texturing
